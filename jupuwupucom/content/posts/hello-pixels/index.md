First post and zero clue where this is going to go. <img src="featured.png" width="16" alt="baby slime" class="inline pointer-events-none">

Some background though, I just started pixel art and game dev a few months ago, progress is steady.

I am not working on anything specific atm, just building on skillsets.

Things to expect:
* Pixels
    * good ones
    * bad ones
* Programming stuffs
  * stuff that works now
  * future post explaining why what worked now was dumb af and never worked to begin with
